## About Me

I'm a 28-year-old French perpetual student and aspiring digital artist with a passion for [[ArchViz]] and Game Environment Art. After completing a 3-year Game Design program at SupinfoGame Rubika, I embarked on a journey of self-teaching and exploration.  
  
My intellectual pursuits traverse a wide spectrum, aspiring to embrace a polymathic approach. Delving into the intricate depths and esoteric facets of diverse scientific and artistic domains—ranging from anatomy, biology, chemistry, and mathematics to nutrition, new technologies, philosophy, photography, music, and cinema. I find joy and purpose primarily through various forms of media that are able to convey emotions and ideas to a broad audience.  
  
Passionate and proficient in the realm of computer technology, I thrive on leveraging digital tools for creativity and take genuine pleasure in lending a helping hand whenever possible. Identifying as part of the [[INFJ (MBTI)]] personality type, I value empathy and understanding in all interactions.  
  
I'm looking forward to connecting with professionals whose work I admire, regardless of their field or social standing. My guiding principle echoes Maya Angelou's wise words:

> *“I’ve learned that people will forget what you said, people will forget what you did, but people will never forget how you made them feel.”*
