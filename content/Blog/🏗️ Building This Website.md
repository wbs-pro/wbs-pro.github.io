### Lessons Learned While Creating This Website

After much contemplation about creating a website, I decided to embark on this project in a way that would be both engaging and educational. My goal was to share insights that reflect my unique perspective, allowing others to glimpse how I approach various topics.

I was already familiar with [[Obsidian]] and admired its navigation style, particularly the visual links and backlinks graph view. This method resonates with me as it helps me connect ideas and discover creative solutions to problems.

In my search for a suitable platform, I prioritized open-source and free solutions to avoid any subscription fees. This led me to a promising project on [[GitHub]] that aligned perfectly with my vision for the website. After following various instructions and tutorials, I worked to bridge my knowledge gaps and set everything up.

As is often my practice, I began by examining existing, functional websites. I created a sandbox environment to replicate and deconstruct these sites, engaging in what could be described as a form of reverse engineering. This process involved analyzing various websites built on similar foundations, focusing on specific elements that piqued my interest.

For instance, I explored how a particular font was configured for displaying dates or how a collapsible quote block was designed with a unique visual style. This hands-on investigation prompted me to refresh my knowledge of web technologies like CSS and HTML, enabling me to achieve the aesthetic I envisioned for my own website.

### Tools I Used

- **[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (IDE)**: For coding and linking to GitHub.
- **ChatGPT (4o model)**: To clarify specific contexts while setting up SSH keys and troubleshooting error codes that weren't covered in the setup instructions.
- **GitHub**: For hosting the website using GitHub Pages.
- **[Obsidian](https://github.com/obsidianmd)**: For drafting and organizing my content.
- **[Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz)**: For converting my Obsidian vault into a functional website.

This journey has not only been about building a website but also about enhancing my skills and understanding in the process. I hope to create a platform that resonates with others and showcases my approach to various ideas.
