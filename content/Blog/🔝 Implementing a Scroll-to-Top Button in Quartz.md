### Implementing a Scroll-to-Top Button in Quartz

Integrating a scroll-to-top button into our Quartz-based website was a goal I had in mind, but I initially felt uncertain about where to begin or what knowledge I would need. However, by utilizing the [Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) IDE and Claude 3.5, I was able to successfully implement the feature with minimal coding on my part, all while gaining insights into modern concepts that enhanced my understanding of HTML and CSS. Below is a brief overview of the process, the challenges faced, and the solutions I developed with the assistance of LLMs as my project copilot.

In fact, the following outline of the article was also written with the assistance of Claude after the feature was successfully implemented:


## Creating the Component

1. The process began with the creation of a new file named `ScrollToTop.tsx` within the `quartz/components` directory.
2. The component was designed as a straightforward button featuring an SVG icon representing an upward arrow.
3. Quartz's component system was leveraged by implementing the `QuartzComponent` interface.

## Styling the Button

1. A new SCSS file, `scrollToTop.scss`, was created in the `quartz/components/styles` directory.
2. The button was styled to be circular and fixed at the bottom-right corner of the viewport.
3. Transitions were incorporated for a smooth appearance and hover effects.
4. The button was made responsive to accommodate various screen sizes and was designed to react and function with the existing dark and light theme functionality in Quartz.

## Adding Functionality

1. The `afterDOMLoaded` property was utilized to introduce JavaScript functionality.
2. Logic was implemented to show or hide the button based on the user's scroll position.
3. A smooth scroll effect was added to create a more natural movement when the button is clicked.

> [!NOTE]
> This approach aligns with motion design principles outlined in Google’s Material Design documentation, which offers a clear and well-illustrated explanation of motion concepts: [https://m2.material.io/design/motion/understanding-motion.html#principles](https://m2.material.io/design/motion/understanding-motion.html#principles).

## Challenges and Solutions

1. **Component Integration**: Initially, there were challenges integrating the component into Quartz's layout. This was resolved by properly exporting the component and including it in the `quartz/components/index.ts` file.
    
2. **Button Visibility**: The button was initially always visible. This was addressed by adding a `visible` class and toggling it based on the scroll position.
    
3. **Scroll Behavior**: To ensure smooth scrolling across different browsers, `window.scrollTo` was used with the `behavior: 'smooth'` option, providing a consistent experience.
    
4. **Performance**: To mitigate performance issues, a debounce function on the scroll event listener was considered during development.
    
5. **Styling Conflicts**: Careful management of z-index and positioning was necessary to ensure the button did not interfere with other fixed elements on the page.
    

## Final Implementation

The final result was a clean, functional, and visually appealing scroll-to-top button that significantly enhances user navigation on lengthy pages.

Key files modified:

- `quartz/components/ScrollToTop.tsx`
- `quartz/components/styles/scrollToTop.scss`
- `quartz.layout.ts` (to include the component in the layout)

## Conclusion

Implementing this feature was a valuable exercise in utilizing Quartz's component system while balancing functionality and performance. It highlights how small UI enhancements can greatly improve website navigation and overall user experience.

### Tools I Used

- **[Cursor](https://www.cursor.com/) (IDE)**: Used for coding and integrating the feature, leveraging its ability to feed the LLM with the codebase and utilize its AI Composer for better understanding and modification of the relevant files.
- **Claude 3.5**: This was the primary LLM I relied on to implement the feature. Although it was my first time using it with Cursor for coding a small feature, it helped me achieve a working function in about a dozen queries. Given that I was quite detail-oriented and this was my first attempt, the final workflow would likely require fewer queries.
- **Chromium-Based Browser Developer Tools**: Utilized for debugging and testing the implementation.

This project not only improved the website's usability but also deepened my understanding of web development practices.
