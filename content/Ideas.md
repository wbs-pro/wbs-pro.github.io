- [ ] Add contact page? (cf. Photographe website) Able to forward emails? Have it being sent so that it's easy they sent it from my website so make it a priority in my inbox 
- [ ] Have some kind of tool to easily translate the webpage with AI to bypass the Google Translate thing, maybe by detecting the language of the web-browser the visitor is using
- [ ] Have some kind of tutorial based on how to navigate the website based on a cookie (might be an issue because of the GDPR shit), or on IP address maybe.
