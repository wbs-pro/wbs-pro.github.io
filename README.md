Quartz is a static site generator and publishing tool. It can turn your Obsidian notes into a fully functional website for free. It supports various features like backlinks, graph view, darkmode, and more. Quartz was originally designed as a tool to publish Obsidian vaults as websites, but its scope has widened over time to support other Markdown flavors. Quartz can also be extended via plugins that allow you to customize the parsing, filtering, and page generation process. See the documentation for more details.
